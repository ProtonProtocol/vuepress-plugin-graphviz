inside `<mermaid></mermaid>`-Tags, like so:

graph lR
Documentation--with diagrams-->_[is Awesome]

```

yielding:
<mermaid>
graph LR
Documentation--with diagrams-->_[is Awesome]
</mermaid>

# Known Caveats

- Hot-Reloading does not work all-to-well with the
rendering engine. If you have any ideas, please open
a [Pull Request][pr]!
- Some VuePress configurations don't seem to work
  well with a minified version of mermaid, there
  is an [issue][#5] for ideas.
